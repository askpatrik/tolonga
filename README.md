- 👋 Hi, I’m @tolonga
- 👀 I’m interested in creating modern software applications and to revolutionize already existing platforms. My strengths are my patience, accuracy and curiosity to learn. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studing system science in Sweden and will be finished in 2024. My goal is to secure an employment before that. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GitHub!
- 📫 How to reach me: via hotmail.
